This is simple proof of concept to fetch and show some data from US Agriculture API.
 
To switch between api and mock api please import either:
```
import api from "./api";
```
or
```
import api from "./api/fake";
```
in `App.js` component

It uses some files from youtube example hence components are named VideoList, VideoItem etc. ;)
